Hey There ..!!

You have done a :sparkles: Great Job :sparkles:
Making the changes and submitting the project in such a short span of time clearly reflects your hardwork and dedication towards the project. ...:thumbsup: :clap:
You are close to the appropriate project. Just need to make a couple to small changes  :collision:

PS : I know it becomes frustrating to get rejected and submit again. But as Thomas A. Edison said :
I have not failed. I have just found 10000 ways that won't work !!. Don't take it as a rejection but consider it as a learning lesson .. ‚úåüòä

Hope you make the required changes soon.
We look forward to receiving your future project submissions. ‚úå

Keep learning and stay Udacious

Responsive Design
All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes.

Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes.

An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.

Awesome !!
The responsive design is really awesome. :star2:
It is using the available screen real estate perfectly. :clap:

Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.

Great work working with images. Images are sized appropriate to the viewport ..:star:

Responsive Images
On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.

‚≠êGood job properly displaying restaurant details in all viewports! ‚≠ê

Accessibility
All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.

The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it. Great to see that appropriate alt attribute has been associated with the content-images. :collision:

Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

The focus has been appropriately managed. :tada: The screen does not flicker while scrolling. Nicely done. :star: :star:

Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.

Excellent !!
Appropriate ARIA roles for elements that are not semantic are included. :thumbsup:

## Offline Availability
When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.

A great attempt in implementing the service worker. You are very close here.

We must integrate the offline mode on both the pages by registering service worker on both the pages.

Here are some resources that will help you to learn more about service workers & PWA:
